The most common is JPG format on World Wide Web, that is the format for storing and transferring photos and JPG format photo colour is more bright. In addition, animated GIFs are images in the GIF file format that appear to move. GIF format is used for animation support that is single transparent colour and 256 type colour.

		Although each is useful but still have disadvantages, such as the JPG format is the most common but the format does not support transparency and each step of the compressed image will degrade its quality. In addition, JPG format will degraders over time. Disadvantage of using animated GIFs is that once the animation has been coded into the actual GIF file there is no way to go back and edit the image. This may lead to having to start all over again to make a minor adjustment to an image. PNG format is do not support animation and not suitable for full colour images. In addition, PNG format cannot store multiple images in a file.
